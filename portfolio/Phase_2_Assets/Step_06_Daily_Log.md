# Step 6: Daily Log

**Phase**: 🟩 Phase 2: Knowledge Assets
**Action**: Record daily trials, successes, and errors.

> [!TIP]
> Use Notion, Obsidian, or simple text files.

## Applied in Platform All
**Project**: `Original_Development_Plan/docs`

### 💡 The Habit
I turned every development step into a written asset.
- **Method**: Daily logs were not just "diaries" but structured data that fed into next day's planning.
- **Evidence**: The entire `Original_Development_Plan/docs` folder is essentially a massive, structured log of the project's evolution.

### 🔗 Evidence
- [[../../platform_all/Original_Development_Plan/docs/README.md|Development Docs]]
- Consistent record-keeping structure.
